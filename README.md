# Student Data Collection Survey

## Description
The Student Data Collection Survey is a web form designed to gather information from students. It consists of multiple pages with questions about the students' demographics, education, and preferences.

## Best Practices for Forms
In developing the Student Data Collection Survey, several best practices for forms were adhered to. Firstly, the form has clear and descriptive labels for each input field, enhancing usability and ensuring users understand the purpose of each question. Additionally, the form is logically organized into multiple pages, with each page focusing on specific categories of information. This helps prevent overwhelming users with too many questions on a single page and improves the overall user experience. On all of the pages, required fields are clearly indicated, helping users to provide necessary information while avoiding errors after they submit.

## User Accessibility
The Student Data Collection Survey prioritizes user accessibility by implementing several features. Firstly, all form elements are properly labeled using semantic HTML, which assists screen readers in interpreting the content accurately for visually impaired users. Additionally, the form is designed to be navigable using keyboard controls, ensuring that users who rely on keyboard navigation can easily move through the survey without encountering barriers. Moreover, appropriate color contrast and font sizes are utilized to enhance readability for users with visual impairments. These accessibility considerations aim to ensure that the survey is usable and inclusive for all students, regardless of their abilities.
